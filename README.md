# ðŸš— Smart Parking System using Arduino

This project is a **Smart Parking System** that automates gate control and slot detection using:

- IR sensors for vehicle detection
- Servo motors for gate movement
- An ultrasonic sensor to check parking slot availability
- An I2C LCD to display system status

It simulates a real-world single-slot parking system with entry and exit automation.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- **Entry Gate:**
  - Detects a car using IR sensor.
  - If the parking slot is **available**, it opens the gate (servo rotates), allowing the car in.
  - If the slot is **occupied**, it displays **"No Slots!"** and keeps the gate closed.

- **Exit Gate:**
  - Detects a car using IR sensor.
  - Opens the gate for exit and closes after the car passes.

- **Parking Slot Detection:**
  - Ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors distance.
  - If distance > 10 cm â†’ slot is available.
  - If distance â‰¤ 10 cm â†’ slot is occupied.

- **LCD Display:**
  - Displays real-time system states like:
    - Car detected
    - Opening/Closing gates
    - Slot availability

## ðŸ”Œ Setup Instructions

1. **Wiring:**
   - Connect components as per the pin configuration.
   - Ensure a stable power supply for servos.

2. **Install Libraries:**
   In the Arduino IDE:
   - Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**
   - Install:
     - `Servo`
     - `LiquidCrystal_I2C`

3. **Upload the Code:**
   - Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
   - Select the correct board and COM port
   - Upload the code
